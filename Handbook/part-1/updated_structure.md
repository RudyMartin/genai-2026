Excellent choice! This approach will provide both comprehensive international context and practical decision-making skills. Let me create the new Chapter 1.5 and show how to integrate international examples throughout the existing chapters.Now let me create examples of how to integrate international perspectives into your existing chapters:Perfect! Here's your enhanced course structure with international perspectives:

## **üåç Updated Course Structure**

### **üìò PART 1: Foundations of Model Risk in Banking**

| Chapter | Topic | Banking Scenario | International Integration |
|---------|-------|------------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | **Intro to Model Risk in Finance** | Credit scoring, capital adequacy | *Global risk frameworks comparison* |
| **1.5** | **üåç Global Regulatory Landscape** | **Jurisdictional decision-making** | **Beyond SR 11-7: EU, UK, Singapore, Canada** |
| 2 | **Credit Risk Models** | Auto loan underwriting | *Germany (Schufa), Singapore (SME), UK (Consumer Duty)* |
| 3 | **AML Surveillance** | Wire transfer flagging | *Netherlands (SWIFT), Hong Kong (RMB), Canada (FINTRAC)* |
| 4 | **Model Documentation** | Writing reports for audit | *Multi-jurisdiction documentation strategies* |
| 5 | **Validation Checklists** | What validators look for | *International validator expectations* |

## **Key Benefits of This Approach**

### **1. Practical Decision-Making Skills**
Students learn to ask the right questions:
- "Which jurisdiction's requirements apply to my situation?"
- "How do I balance compliance cost with business objectives?"
- "What's the most efficient way to satisfy multiple regulators?"

### **2. Real-World Complexity**
Each chapter now includes scenarios like:
- **Chapter 2**: "Should I build to German AI Act standards first, then adapt for US SR 11-7, or vice versa?"
- **Chapter 3**: "How do I design AML surveillance that works across US FinCEN, EU AMLD, and Singapore MAS requirements?"

### **3. Cultural and Market Awareness**
Students understand that compliance isn't just about rules:
- Japanese chatbots need honorific language consideration
- Singapore systems must handle multi-ethnic fairness
- German systems require GDPR "right to explanation"

### **4. Cost-Effective Implementation**
The course teaches strategic thinking:
- Identify common requirements across jurisdictions
- Choose the most restrictive standard as baseline when appropriate
- Layer on jurisdiction-specific requirements efficiently

## **ü§ñ Enhanced AI Assistant Tips Throughout**

Each chapter now includes jurisdiction-aware prompts:
- **"Generate compliance checklist for credit model operating in [US/EU/UK/Singapore]"**
- **"Create documentation template satisfying [multiple regulators] for [specific use case]"**
- **"Design testing protocol considering [local cultural factors] and [regulatory requirements]"**

## **üìã Practical Implementation Benefits**

### **For Students:**
- Learn to navigate real-world regulatory complexity
- Develop strategic thinking about compliance choices
- Gain globally applicable skills
- Understand cultural considerations in AI deployment

### **For Organizations:**
- Graduates can handle international projects immediately

This approach transforms your course from a specialized US certification into the **definitive global banking AI governance education**. Students graduate with both deep technical knowledge and practical skills for navigating the complex international regulatory landscape.

Would you like me to develop any specific chapter integration in more detail, or shall we move on to creating the practical exercises and capstone projects with international scenarios?
