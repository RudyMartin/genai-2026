# MVP1 Specification & Risk Mitigation Framework

## üéØ Guiding Principles

### **Specification-First Development**
**"No code without complete requirements"** - Every line of code must trace back to a signed-off specification. This prevents the most common cause of project failure: building the wrong thing efficiently.

### **Gate-Based Quality Assurance**
**"Fail fast, fail cheap"** - Each development phase has specific exit criteria that must be met before proceeding. Finding problems early costs exponentially less than finding them in production.

### **Stakeholder-Driven Success Metrics**
**"Success is defined by users, not developers"** - Technical achievements mean nothing if they don't solve real business problems. All metrics must be meaningful to the people who will actually use the system.

### **Risk-Aware Architecture**
**"Plan for failure, design for recovery"** - Every system component should have a failure mode analysis and recovery strategy. Assume things will go wrong and build accordingly.

### **Modular, Testable Design**
**"Build to change, not to last"** - Requirements will evolve. Architecture should enable modification rather than resist it. Every component should be independently testable and replaceable.

### **Documentation as Code**
**"Undocumented systems are unmaintainable systems"** - Documentation isn't an afterthought - it's a deliverable. Every decision, every integration, every failure mode must be documented for future maintainers.

### **Corporate Reality Integration**
**"Technology serves business processes, not the reverse"** - Solutions must fit into existing corporate workflows, compliance requirements, and operational procedures. The best technical solution that can't be deployed is worthless.

## üö® Project Risk Analysis
- **Specification overlap**: Development starts Week 2 while requirements gathering continues through Week 4
- **Stakeholder alignment risk**: No formal sign-off gates before technical work begins
- **Scope creep vulnerability**: Agents defined simultaneously with platform integration
- **Testing dependency**: User acceptance criteria undefined until Week 9 pilot

## üìã Pre-Development Specification Checklist

### Phase 0: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
**Must complete BEFORE any coding begins**

#### Business Requirements Validation
- [ ] **Success metrics defined and agreed**: What constitutes "successful triage"? Target accuracy %?
- [ ] **Failure scenarios documented**: What happens when agent gets it wrong?
- [ ] **Volume expectations**: How many docs/tickets per day/week?
- [ ] **Response time SLAs**: Real-time vs batch processing requirements?
- [ ] **User personas mapped**: Who uses which agent and how?

#### Technical Specifications
- [ ] **Data schema locked**: Document types, Jira fields, metadata structure
- [ ] **API contracts defined**: Input/output formats, error responses
- [ ] **Integration points specified**: Exact Jira queues, S3 buckets, Confluence spaces
- [ ] **Security requirements**: Authentication, authorization, data handling
- [ ] **Scalability limits**: Concurrent users, document sizes, processing volumes

#### Stakeholder Sign-offs
- [ ] **Sonia's team approval**: Risk document types and preview requirements
- [ ] **Support team buy-in**: Jira routing rules and comment standards
- [ ] **IT/Security clearance**: Platform access, data governance compliance
- [ ] **Budget/resource confirmation**: AWS costs, development hours, maintenance

## üîß Development Approach Examples

The following illustrates how modular development supports the principles above, but **actual architecture and file structure should be determined during Phase 0 specification**:

### Example: Phased Development with Clear Dependencies
```
Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Data ingestion and validation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Embedding and vector storage
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Shared utilities and configuration

Phase 2: Agent Frameworks  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Base agent architecture
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Domain-specific agent implementations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Output formatting and validation

Phase 3: Integration Layer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ API endpoints and interfaces
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User interfaces and dashboards
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ External system integrations
```

**Note**: Specific technologies, file structures, and implementation details must be defined during specification phase based on actual requirements, not predetermined here.

## ‚ùì Critical Questions Checklist

### Business Context
1. **What's the current manual process?** How long does doc review/ticket triage take today?
2. **What's the cost of being wrong?** Impact of mislabeled risk doc or misrouted ticket?
3. **Who are the actual end users?** Are they the same people giving requirements?
4. **What's the fallback plan?** If agents fail, how do we revert to manual process?
5. **How will success be measured?** Time saved? Accuracy improved? User satisfaction?

### Technical Constraints
6. **What's the data quality like?** Are documents standardized? Jira fields consistent?
7. **What are the performance requirements?** Real-time responses or batch processing acceptable?
8. **How much data are we dealing with?** Historical ticket volume, document archive size?
9. **What's the maintenance plan?** Who retrains models when they drift?
10. **Are there compliance requirements?** Data retention, audit trails, user permissions?

### Risk Assessment
11. **What could go wrong?** Security breaches, model bias, system downtime?
12. **How do we detect problems?** Monitoring, alerting, feedback loops?
13. **What's the rollback strategy?** Can we disable agents quickly if needed?
14. **Who's accountable for mistakes?** Legal liability, operational responsibility?
15. **How do we validate before launch?** Testing approach, acceptance criteria?

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Gate 1: Specification Sign-off (End of Week 3)
**No development starts without:**
- Written requirements document approved by all stakeholders
- Technical architecture review completed
- Data access permissions granted
- Success metrics and testing plan agreed

### Gate 2: Core Infrastructure Validation (End of Week 5)
**No agent development starts without:**
- Data ingestion pipeline successfully processing sample data
- Embedding service producing consistent vector representations
- Retrieval system returning relevant results for test queries
- Error handling and logging working correctly

### Gate 3: Agent Validation (End of Week 7)
**No UI development starts without:**
- Both agents producing outputs that match specification
- Evaluation runs meeting minimum accuracy thresholds
- Stakeholder review of sample outputs completed
- Performance benchmarks met (response time, throughput)

### Gate 4: Integration Testing (End of Week 9)
**No production deployment without:**
- Full end-to-end testing completed
- Security review passed
- Load testing within acceptable limits
- Rollback procedures validated

## üìä Timeline with Gates

| Week | Focus | Gate | Deliverables |
|------|--------|------|-------------|
| 1-3 | **Specification** | Gate 1 | Requirements doc, architecture, sign-offs |
| 4-5 | **Infrastructure** | Gate 2 | Data pipelines, embedding service, retrieval |
| 6-7 | **Agent Development** | Gate 3 | Working agents, evaluation results |
| 8-9 | **Integration & Testing** | Gate 4 | UI, APIs, full system testing |
| 10 | **Deployment** | Launch | Production-ready system |

## üîÑ Continuous Validation Approach

### Daily Standups Focus
- **Blockers**: What's preventing gate completion?
- **Dependencies**: What do we need from other teams?
- **Risks**: What could derail the timeline?

### Weekly Gate Reviews
- **Stakeholder demo**: Show progress against specifications
- **Technical review**: Code quality, architecture compliance
- **Risk assessment**: Update mitigation strategies

### Iterative Refinement
- **Prototype early**: Build minimal versions for stakeholder feedback
- **Test continuously**: Don't wait for full integration
- **Document decisions**: Why we chose specific approaches
- **Plan for change**: Modular design enables scope adjustments

This framework ensures structured development with clear quality gates while maintaining development velocity within a realistic corporate timeline.
