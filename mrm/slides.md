# MVP1 Specification & Risk Mitigation Framework
## Slide Presentation Format

## Slide 1: Guiding Principles

### **Our Development Philosophy**
‚Ä¢ **Specification-First**: No code without complete requirements
‚Ä¢ **Gate-Based Quality**: Fail fast, fail cheap with clear exit criteria
‚Ä¢ **User-Driven Success**: Success defined by users, not developers
‚Ä¢ **Risk-Aware Design**: Plan for failure, design for recovery
‚Ä¢ **Modular Architecture**: Build to change, not to last
‚Ä¢ **Documentation as Code**: Undocumented systems are unmaintainable
‚Ä¢ **Corporate Integration**: Technology serves business processes

---

## Slide 2: Project Risk Analysis

### **Common AI Project Failure Patterns**
‚Ä¢ **Specification overlap**: Development and requirements happening simultaneously
‚Ä¢ **Stakeholder misalignment**: Technical work before formal agreement
‚Ä¢ **Scope creep**: Multiple complex systems defined concurrently
‚Ä¢ **Testing dependency**: User acceptance criteria deferred until late

### **Impact**
‚Ä¢ Costly rework cycles
‚Ä¢ Missed business requirements
‚Ä¢ Quality compromises under deadline pressure

## Slide 3: Pre-Development Specification Checklist

### **Phase 0: Foundation (Weeks 1-3) - COMPLETE BEFORE CODING**

**Business Requirements:**
‚Ä¢ Success metrics defined and agreed
‚Ä¢ Failure scenarios documented
‚Ä¢ Volume expectations established
‚Ä¢ Response time SLAs confirmed
‚Ä¢ User personas mapped

**Technical Specifications:**
‚Ä¢ Data schema locked
‚Ä¢ API contracts defined
‚Ä¢ Integration points specified
‚Ä¢ Security requirements confirmed
‚Ä¢ Scalability limits established

---

## Slide 4: Stakeholder Sign-off Requirements

### **Required Approvals Before Development**
‚Ä¢ **Sonia's team**: Risk document types and preview requirements
‚Ä¢ **Support team**: Jira routing rules and comment standards
‚Ä¢ **IT/Security**: Platform access and data governance compliance
‚Ä¢ **Budget/Finance**: AWS costs, development hours, maintenance

### **No Exceptions Policy**
‚Ä¢ Written requirements document approved by ALL stakeholders
‚Ä¢ Technical architecture review completed
‚Ä¢ Data access permissions granted
‚Ä¢ Success metrics and testing plan agreed

---

## Slide 5: Development Approach Example

### **Phased Development with Clear Dependencies**

**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
‚Ä¢ Data ingestion and validation
‚Ä¢ Embedding and vector storage
‚Ä¢ Shared utilities and configuration

**Phase 2: Agent Frameworks**
‚Ä¢ Base agent architecture
‚Ä¢ Domain-specific implementations
‚Ä¢ Output formatting and validation

**Phase 3: Integration Layer**
‚Ä¢ API endpoints and interfaces
‚Ä¢ User interfaces and dashboards
‚Ä¢ External system integrations

---

## Slide 6: Critical Questions Checklist

### **Business Context**
‚Ä¢ What's the current manual process timeline?
‚Ä¢ What's the cost of being wrong?
‚Ä¢ Who are the actual end users?
‚Ä¢ What's the fallback plan if agents fail?

### **Technical Constraints**
‚Ä¢ What's the data quality like?
‚Ä¢ Real-time or batch processing requirements?
‚Ä¢ How much historical data exists?
‚Ä¢ Who maintains the system long-term?

### **Risk Assessment**
‚Ä¢ What could go wrong?
‚Ä¢ How do we detect problems?
‚Ä¢ What's the rollback strategy?
‚Ä¢ Who's accountable for mistakes?

---

## Slide 7: Gate-Based Quality Assurance

### **Gate 1: Specification Sign-off (Week 3)**
‚Ä¢ Requirements approved by all stakeholders
‚Ä¢ Technical architecture reviewed
‚Ä¢ Data access permissions granted

### **Gate 2: Infrastructure Validation (Week 5)**
‚Ä¢ Data pipeline processing sample data
‚Ä¢ Embedding service producing consistent vectors
‚Ä¢ Retrieval system returning relevant results

### **Gate 3: Agent Validation (Week 7)**
‚Ä¢ Agents producing spec-compliant outputs
‚Ä¢ Evaluation runs meeting accuracy thresholds
‚Ä¢ Stakeholder review of sample outputs completed

### **Gate 4: Integration Testing (Week 9)**
‚Ä¢ End-to-end testing completed
‚Ä¢ Security review passed
‚Ä¢ Load testing within limits

---

## Slide 8: Project Timeline

### **12-Week Gate-Based Schedule**

| **Weeks** | **Focus** | **Gate** | **Key Deliverables** |
|-----------|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| 1-3 | Specification | Gate 1 | Requirements, architecture, sign-offs |
| 4-5 | Infrastructure | Gate 2 | Data pipelines, embedding, retrieval |
| 6-7 | Agent Development | Gate 3 | Working agents, evaluation results |
| 8-9 | Integration & Testing | Gate 4 | UI, APIs, full system testing |
| 10-12 | Deployment | Launch | Production-ready system |

---

## Slide 9: Continuous Validation

### **Daily Standups Focus**
‚Ä¢ **Blockers**: What's preventing gate completion?
‚Ä¢ **Dependencies**: What do we need from other teams?
‚Ä¢ **Risks**: What could derail the timeline?

### **Weekly Gate Reviews**
‚Ä¢ **Stakeholder demo**: Progress against specifications
‚Ä¢ **Technical review**: Code quality, architecture compliance
‚Ä¢ **Risk assessment**: Update mitigation strategies

### **Quality Practices**
‚Ä¢ Prototype early for stakeholder feedback
‚Ä¢ Test continuously, don't wait for integration
‚Ä¢ Document all decisions and rationale

## Slide 10: Success Framework

### **This Framework Ensures**
‚Ä¢ Structured development with clear quality gates
‚Ä¢ Stakeholder alignment before technical commitment
‚Ä¢ Risk mitigation throughout project lifecycle
‚Ä¢ Realistic corporate timeline with built-in validation

### **Expected Outcomes**
